# Travel Route Planner - Flutter App

A beautiful Flutter mobile app that consumes the Travel Route Planner Go API to provide intelligent route optimization for both locations and countries.

## Features

### 🗺️ **Route Optimizer**
- **Smart Location Routing**: Add multiple locations with coordinates, addresses, and categories
- **Operating Hours Integration**: Set operating hours for each location with automatic scheduling
- **Travel Time Optimization**: Minimize travel distances using Nearest Neighbor + 2-Opt algorithms
- **Visit Duration Planning**: Customize visit times or use intelligent category-based defaults
- **Time-Aware Planning**: Schedule routes with start times and dates
- **Beautiful Results**: Visual timeline showing optimized route with arrival/departure times

### 🌍 **Country Planner**  
- **Multi-Country Trip Planning**: Plan complex international itineraries
- **Seasonal Intelligence**: Optimize visits based on ideal travel seasons and weather
- **Three Optimization Strategies**:
  - **Distance**: Minimize travel distances between countries
  - **Season**: Prioritize ideal travel times and weather
  - **Balanced**: Perfect mix of distance and seasonal optimization
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Distance, seasonal scores, and overall trip optimization
- **Flexible Parameters**: Set trip duration, start dates, and minimum stay requirements

> Note: This is a functional demo app. In a production version, you would add screenshots here showing the beautiful UI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Go API server running (see `../api/README.md`)
- iOS Simulator / Android Emulator or physical device

### Installation

1. **Navigate to the Flutter app directory**:
   ```bash
   cd src/packages/flutter-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Start the Go API server** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   cd ../api
   go run main.go route_optimizer.go country_optimizer.go
   ```

4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### API Configuration

The app is configured to connect to the Go API running on `http://localhost:8081`. If you need to change this:

1. Edit `lib/services/api_client.dart`
2. Update the `_baseUrl` constant to your API server address

## Architecture

### State Management
- **Riverpod**: Modern, type-safe state management with excellent developer experience
- **Provider Pattern**: Clean separation of business logic and UI components

### Key Features
- **Type-Safe Models**: Auto-generated JSON serialization matching Go API structs
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Loading States**: Beautiful loading indicators and smooth UX
- **Form Validation**: Input validation with helpful error messages
- **Material Design 3**: Modern, accessible UI following Material Design guidelines

## API Integration

The app integrates with the following Go API endpoints:

### Route Optimization
```
POST /api/v1/optimize-route
```
**Request**: List of locations with coordinates, categories, operating hours
**Response**: Optimized route with timing details and distance metrics

### Country Optimization  
```
POST /api/v1/optimize-countries
```
**Request**: List of countries with seasonal data and trip parameters
**Response**: Optimized itinerary with seasonal scores and travel metrics

### Health Check
```
GET /api/v1/health
```
**Response**: API health status

## Development

### Code Generation
When you modify models, regenerate JSON serialization:
```bash
dart run build_runner build
```

### Testing
Run tests:
```bash
flutter test
```

### Analysis
Check code quality:
```bash
flutter analyze
```

## Example Usage

### Route Optimization Example
1. Add locations (restaurants, museums, shops, etc.)
2. Set categories for intelligent visit time estimation
3. Configure operating hours if needed
4. Set start time and date
5. Choose whether to return to starting point
6. Tap "Optimize Route" to get optimized itinerary

### Country Planning Example  
1. Add countries with capitals and coordinates
2. Set ideal travel seasons and months to avoid
3. Configure minimum stay durations
4. Set trip start date and total duration
5. Choose optimization strategy (distance/season/balanced)
6. Tap "Optimize Trip" to get optimized itinerary
