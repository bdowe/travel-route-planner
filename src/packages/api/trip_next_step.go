// trip_next_step.go — the "Next Step" projection (specs/next-step-cta): the
// single recommended next planning action for a trip, derived as the FIRST
// unmet phase of a fixed ladder (dates → itinerary → booking slots in
// itinerary order → schedule → bookings → packing). Like trip_review.go it is
// DETERMINISTIC and read-only: derived only from persisted data and the
// deterministic findings, never from the live weather/hours enrichment — so
// the step is identical whether or not the caller opted into check_hours, and
// both client cache variants agree.
//
// deriveNextStep is composed AFTER reviewTrip at both call sites (the review
// handler and the review_trip agent tool); phase 3 walks the client-synced
// booking todos in position order (flights before stays, per destination —
// see walkBookingSlots), falling back to the lodging/transit findings only
// for trips with no derived slots, and reads the extra signals (zero items,
// unbooked booking todos, empty packing checklist) straight off exportData.
// Budget, weather and opening hours are deliberately NOT phases: a budget
// target is optional, and the live enrichments would make the step flap
// between fetches.

// NextStep is the first unmet phase of the planning ladder. Title/Detail are
// localized display copy; SeedPrompt is CANONICAL ENGLISH (specs/i18n-spanish:
// it is agent input, not display copy — the client shows Title instead, and
// the templates live here as English constants precisely so nobody localizes
// them). Fix reuses the finding-fix contract so the client's existing
// apply-fix plumbing handles the mechanical path without new action types.
